For example, in Engineering,  140 students are interested (observed) compared to 96.67 (expected), and 60 are not interested (observed) compared to 103.33 (expected).\n",
        "+ **Conclusion**: The test results indicate that **students' academic majors significantly influence their interests in enrolling in online courses**. This significant difference suggests that students' interest in enrollig in online courses varies significantly depending on their academic majors."
